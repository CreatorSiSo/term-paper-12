# term-paper-12

My term paper for year 12 discovering recent changes in the field of programming languages.

This was originally written using [Quarto](https://quarto.org) but has since been ported to [Typst](https://typst.app).

The state this was in when I submitted it can be seen in the [quarto branch](https://github.com/CreatorSiSo/term-paper-12/tree/quarto) and many intermediate versions of the pdf output are saved in the [archive branch](https://github.com/CreatorSiSo/term-paper-12/tree/archive).
