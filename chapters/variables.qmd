Immutable

```rym
const example_1 = 99
example_1 = 100     // error: Cannot assing to immutable variable example_1
print(example_1)
```

Mutable

```rym
mut example_1 = 99
example_1 = 100
print(example_1) // prints "100"
```

## Operators

For example, in Java, a user can increment a simple integer variable in four different ways:

    count = count + 1
    count += 1
    count++
    ++count

Although the last two statements have slightly different meanings from each
other and from the others in some contexts, all of them have the same
meaning when used as stand-alone expressions. These variations are
discussed in Chapter 7.
