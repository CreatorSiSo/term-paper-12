# Variables {#sec-variables}

For example, in Java, a user can increment a simple integer variable in four different ways:

    count = count + 1
    count += 1
    count++
    ++count

Although the last two statements have slightly different meanings from each
other and from the others in some contexts, all of them have the same
meaning when used as stand-alone expressions. These variations are
discussed in Chapter 7.
