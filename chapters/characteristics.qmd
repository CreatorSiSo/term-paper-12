As the goal of this paper is to create a new programming language finding out which characteristics of a programming language are advantageous is curcial.

<!-- - crucial to understand the key features that can improve the development process
- effective and easy to use for programmers
- impact on the coding experience. -->

- broad
  - readable
  - writable
  - reliable
- general
  - simple
  - expressive
  - flat learning curve
  - save
  - future proof
- specific
  - aliasing
  - type checking
  - as few things to think about at once as possible
  - standardized

readability
  familiar syntax
  `{}` is a block (vs. `end`/`end if`)
  might not make as much sense for non programmers
  comparable with the way that `+` and other math notation could be considered less readable then `plus`
